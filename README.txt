DATA SCIENCE PROJECT - PREDICTING DIABETIC RETINOPATHY

Bob Zhu, Cole Roseth, Sophie Boileau, Shreya Nair

Project Description : Using images of retinal scans to detect the presence of Diabetic Retinopathy on a scale of 0-4 using deep learning models. 

Things to work on : 

- Cross Validation 
- ROC/AUC curves to evaluate model
- Image processing 
- Attention learning model 

Notes for what we add to what : 
- For the D-R-D (project : Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection by ramanakshay) 
	- Add ROC curves and AUC, add the confusion matrix 
	- add attention learnign 
- For kaggle code : 
	- better image processing and access to images 
	- better model training 
	- maybe add cnn model.
